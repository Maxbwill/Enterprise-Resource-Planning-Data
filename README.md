# Enterprise-Resource-Planning-Data
Estimate how much profit every team member and project brings and predict future value

**The dataset and concept is provided by Maxim Korotkov

This project aims to provide an effective solution for estimating the profitability of a team or business unit through data analysis. We believe that management starts with measurement, and with this project, we aim to help managers and data scientists work together to improve business performance.

The project provides an alternative approach to using expensive ERP systems to estimate team profitability. Instead, we propose using a Jupyter notebook, which allows for quick and efficient data analysis. By leveraging the data from timesheets, project budgets, and approximate costs, our analysis provides a more accurate estimate of team profitability.

To use this project, you will need a dataset of timesheets, project budgets, and costs. Our analysis is conducted in Python, so you will need to have some basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

We hope that this project will be useful for managers and data scientists looking for an efficient and cost-effective solution for estimating team profitability. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or feedback.ss.
